Hello world, this is a short description for my CV web page. It is not ideal, but its ok.
I decided to use my old cv page in this lab work, so I duplicated the page and made some minor changes.
Here is the Home page with some information about me.

This is the second page with the information about my education and working experience(a bit embellished)
![ScreenshotOf_eduPage](C:\Users\Сагадат\Desktop\inf232\Saga\public\edu_page_screen.jpg?raw=true "edu")

And that is the last page with contact information.
